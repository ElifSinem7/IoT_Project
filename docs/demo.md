## Demo Setup

1. Place the sensor node inside a transparent air chamber to allow controlled
   manipulation of air quality conditions.

2. Power on the sensor node and ensure that LoRa communication with the gateway
   is successfully established.

3. Start the backend server to enable data ingestion, storage, and API services.

4. Open the web-based frontend dashboard in a browser to monitor live sensor data.

5. Introduce smoke into the air chamber to simulate a pollution event.

6. Observe the real-time increase in TVOC and eCO₂ values on the dashboard.

7. Verify that the system correctly detects the anomaly and displays alert
   messages both locally (LED/Buzzer) and on the web interface.
